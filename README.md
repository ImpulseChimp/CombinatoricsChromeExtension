combinatorics-chrome-extension
==============================

This is my first chrome extension and was made as an aid for my
Combinatorics class. These are three of the main equation related 
topics I used during the class and found myself using other online 
calculators to calculate this stuff occasionally. So, when I got
interested in learning how to make a chrome extension I decided to 
make this basic calculator.

The three calculations used in the extension calculator are listed below

1. Combination/Permutation
Given the entire body being selected from, n, and the number of values being 
selected from that body, r, the combination or permutation will be computed.
If n is > 100, the value can get extremely large, but I put no bounds on what
can be entered.

2. Edges/Faces/Verticies
This calculates the third value given any of the other two. This uses the 
tried and true equation for planar graphs 

					faces = edges - verticies + 2

As stated before, the graph being considered MUST BE a planar graph.

3. Trees
This calculates the values of a complete tree given any of the two values.
